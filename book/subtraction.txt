Subtraction
===========

Subtraction can cause some headaches, because it is not commutative
`= - 3 4` |rarr| `= -1` but `= - 4 3` |rarr| `= 1`. 

Basic Substitutions
-------------------

.. index:: ! subtraction

Our basic subtraction substitution rule is

.. rst-class:: prefix

   `- a b` |sameas| `+ a ~b` 
   
Be careful to never substitute `+ ~a b` for `- a b`. 

.. minuend - subtrahend = difference 
.. - minuend subtrahend |sameas| difference

.. index:: ! Cancelling the Subtrahend

There is a shortcut we can use, called **Cancelling the Subtrahend**:

.. rst-class:: prefix

   `- + B A B` |sameas| `A`

.. index:: ! opposites

.. note::

    For our purposes, the `-` symbol is the binary operator for
    subtraction. The `~` symbol is the unary operator for negation.
    However, for negative numbers, I am using `-1`' `-2`, etc. I use
    the `~` for negative variables or when negating a operator and
    pair of operands.
    
    We can call `~a` the *Opposite* of `a` and vice-versa.

More Substitutions
-------------------

Subtraction is not commutative, but it can appear in Association 
substitutions:

.. index:: triple: associative; property; subtraction
 
.. rst-class:: prefix

   `+ a - b c` |sameas| `- + a b c`

Compare to the infix form: :math:`a + (b - c) = (a + b) - c`.

In infix notation, :math:`a - (b + c) \ne (a - b) + c`. These
are `- a + b c` and `+ - a b c` in prefix. Going from left to right,
we could use the basic subtraction substitution rule to go from
`- a + b c` to `+ a ~ + b c` and we don't have a rule for this yet.

Going from right to left we can
turn `+ - a b c` into `+ + a ~b c`, which we could (through normal
Association) get `+ a + ~b c`. 

Let's deal with that `~ + b c` item. `~` is the unary negation, and
to get rid of it and simplify our statements we need to bury the 
negative somewhere else. If you translate this into infix, you'll 
see that this is a distribution problem:

.. index:: 
   pair: addition; opposites
   ! Addition of Opposites

.. list-table:: Addition of Opposites
    :widths: 1 10 10
    :class: proof
    :name: addition-of-opposites
    
    * - 
      - `~ + a b`
      - Given
    * - 
      - `* -1 + a b`
      - Multiplication by -1
    * -
      - `+ * -1 a * -1 b`
      - Distribution
    * -
      - `+ ~a ~b`
      - Multiplication by -1 (twice)

The reverse is true as well, so `~ + b c` |sameas| `+ ~b ~c`.

We can now solve our `+ a ~ + b c` problem. This becomes
`+ a + ~b ~c` and that is not the same as `+ a + ~b c`. 
So we have shown that `- a + b c` cannot be substituted 
for `+ - a b c`.

Multiplying Negative Numbers
----------------------------

Here are the rules for multiplication with negative numbers.

.. index:: pair: multiplication; opposites

.. list-table:: Multiplying Opposites
    :widths: 1 6
    :stub-columns: 1
    :name: multiplying-opposites
    
    * - Commutative
      - `* ~a b` |sameas| `* a ~b` |sameas| `~ * a b`
    * - Distribution
      - `* ~a ~b` |sameas| `* a b`
