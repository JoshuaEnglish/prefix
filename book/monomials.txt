Monomials

Polynomials take up a great deal of most algebra textbooks.
Polynomials are sums (or differences) of monomials, and
with the limited typographic features of prefix notation,
they deserve a little focus.

Let's review the monomial (also called a term) in infix:

.. math::

    3x^2
    
The `3` is the coefficient, `x` is the variable, and 
`2` is the exponent (or power).

In prefix:

.. index:: ! monomial

.. rst-class:: prefix

    * c ^ v e
    
Using `c` for the coefficient, `v` for the variable, and 
`e` for the exponent. 

Monomials can also have multiple variable-power pairs. One 
example is: `* 3 * ^ x 2 ^ y 4`.

With Monomials you have the concept of "like terms", which
means the variable-power pairs have to be the same for two
monomials to be "like" each other enough to add or subtract
them. Naturally, this holds in prefix notation.

You cannot add two monomials unless they are "like terms", as
the following shows:

.. list-table:: Adding non-like monomials

    :class: proof

    * - 1
      - `+ * 3 ^ x 2 * 5 ^ x 1`
      - Given
    * - 2
      - `+ * A B * C D`
      - Abstraction form of line 1

We don't have a rule to handle this abstracted form. We can take 
`+ * 3 ^ x 2 * 5 ^ x 2` and work with it, because the 
abstract form would be `- * A B * C B`.
