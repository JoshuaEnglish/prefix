Properties of Operations
========================

The goal of this book is to develop not simple rules of translation 
and calculation, but to perform algebra.
By this, I mean being able to translate :math:`3x + 2 = 14` into prefix notation 
(:segment:`= + * 3 x 2 14`) and get :segment:`= x 4` (which is :math:`x=4` in
infix notation).

In prefix notation, we work with statements of equality that can be 
true or false. Clearly, the goal is to get true statements, but the
false statements can come in handy to prove something can't be true.

Statements begin with the `=` symbol. A statement is *solved
for a variable* when the variable is the first item after the `=`
and does not occur in the rest of the statement. `= x 5` is considered
solved for `x`. 

True statements are in the form `= a a` where `a` stands for any single
number. `= 0 0` is true, so is `= 45 45`.

Properties of Addition and Multiplication
-----------------------------------------

These properties show portions of statments that can be swapped 
without affecting the truth value of the statement. 

Think of them as *substitution rules* in a statement.

.. note::
    
    In all these examples, the letters `A`, `B`, and `C` can stand in for 
    either a single number or a binary operator followed by two operands.

    * - Commutative
      - `+ A B` |sameas| `+ B A`
      - `* A B` |sameas| `* B A`
    * - Associative
      - `+ + A B C` |sameas| `+ A + B C`
      - `* * A B C` |sameas| `* A * B C`
    * - Distributive
      - `* A + B C` |sameas| `+ * A B * A C`
      - `* A - B C` |sameas| `- * A B * A C`

As noted, the operands can be single things (numbers or variables) or a group of 
three things (operator, operand, operand) or even a group of five
things (operator, operand, operator, operand, operand).

These substitutions can be used anywhere in the statement.


Equality Properties
-------------------

These properties only apply at the beginnig of a statement. These must 
begin with the `=` symbol.
